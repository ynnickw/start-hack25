The Farmers Risk Metrics that relate to what product he might use.

Stress Buster Algorithm

1. Daytime Heat Stress Risk (Max Temperature) 
This algorithm assesses heat stress based on daily maximum air temperature (TMAX) on a 0-9 scale.  

- If TMAX is below or equal to the optimal temperature, stress level is 0 (no stress).  
- If TMAX is between the optimal and limiting temperature, stress is calculated as:  
  9 × [(TMAX - TMaxOptimum) / (TMaxLimit - TMaxOptimum)]
- If TMAX exceeds the limit, stress level is 9 (maximum stress).  

For Wheat: TMaxOptimum = 25°C, TMaxLimit = 32°C 
For Rice: TMaxOptimum = 32°C, TMaxLimit = 38°C  
For Cotton: TMaxOptimum = 32°C, TMaxLimit = 38°C

2. Nighttime Heat Stress Risk (Min Temperature)  
Night heat stress occurs when minimum temperatures (TMIN) remain high, increasing respiration rates and reducing yield. Stress is rated on a 0-9 scale.  

- If TMIN is below the optimal threshold, stress level is 0.  
- If TMIN is between the optimal and limiting temperature, stress is:  
  9 × [(TMIN - TMinOptimum) / (TMinLimit - TMinOptimum)]
- If TMIN exceeds the limit, stress level is 9.  

For Wheat: TMinOptimum = 15°C, TMinLimit = 20°C
For Rice: TMinOptimum = 22°C, TMinLimit = 28°C  
For Cotton: TMinOptimum = 20°C, TMinLimit = 25°C  

If the computed stress level exceeds 9, it is capped at 9.  

3. Frost Stress (Low Temperatures)  
Cold temperatures before crop maturity can result in significant yield loss. Frost risk is determined based on minimum temperature (TMIN).  

- No frost stress if TMIN ≥ 4°C 
- Partial frost stress is calculated as:  
  9 × [ABS(TMIN - TMinNoFrost) / ABS(TminFrost - TMinNoFrost)]  
Severe frost stress if TMIN ≤ TminFrost (stress level = 9).  

For Wheat and Rice, frost stress is not applicable 
For Cotton: TMinNoFrost = 4°C, TminFrost = -3°C  

Final frost stress equation: 9 × [ABS(TMIN - 4) / ABS(-3 - 4)]

4. Drought Risk 
Drought risk is assessed using a **Drought Index (DI)**, which predicts the likelihood of stress based on past and current conditions.  

- DI = (P - E) + SM / T
- P = Total rainfall (mm).  
- E = Total evaporation (mm).  
- SM = Soil moisture content (%).  
- T = Average temperature (°C).  

Risk Interpretation:  
DI > 1 - No drought risk.  
DI = 1 - Medium drought risk.  
DI < 1 - High drought risk.  


Yield Booster Algorithm 

5. Yield Risk Calculation
Yield risk is determined using historical yield data or a formula incorporating temperature, rainfall, soil pH, and nitrogen levels.  

Formula:  
YR = w1(GDD - GDD_opt)² + w2(P - P_opt)² + w3(pH - pH_opt)² + w4(N - N_opt)² 

- GDD = Growing Degree Days.  
- P = Rainfall.  
- pH = Soil pH.  
- N = Nitrogen availability.  

For Wheat: GDD_opt = 2000-2500, P_opt = 1000-1500mm, pH_opt = 5.5-6.5, N_opt = 0.051-0.103 g/kg.  
For Rice: GDD_opt = 2000-2500, P_opt = 1000-1500mm, pH_opt = 5.5-6.5, N_opt = 0.051-0.103 g/kg.  
For Cotton: GDD_opt = 2200-2600, P_opt = 700-1300mm, pH_opt = 6.0-6.5, N_opt = 0.051-0.092 g/kg  

Weighting factors:  
- GDD and precipitation have a higher impact than pH and nitrogen.  
- Example distribution: w1 = 0.3, w2 = 0.3, w3 = 0.2, w4 = 0.2.  
6. Growing Degree Days (GDD) Calculation
GDD = [(Tmax + Tmin) / 2] - Tbase 

Tmax = Maximum daily temperature.  
Tmin = Minimum daily temperature.  
Tbase = Minimum threshold for plant growth.
