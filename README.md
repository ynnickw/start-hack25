# Nature Helps Nature: AI-Driven Agricultural Optimization

_This project proudly secured second place in the Syngenta Challenge at the START Global 2025 Hackathon._

## Overview

This project leverages artificial intelligence to empower farmers in India and Brazil with tailored recommendations for biological products, optimizing crop health and promoting sustainability. By integrating environmental data, product information, and agronomic algorithms, the solution offers:

- **Risk Visualization**: Insights into climate, soil, and disease risks specific to individual fields and crops.
- **Product Recommendations**: Customized suggestions for biological products best suited to the farmer's specific conditions.
- **Outcome Tracking**: Monitoring and analysis of crop performance to refine future recommendations.

## Problem Statement

Farmers often face challenges in selecting appropriate biological products due to limited understanding of product efficacy across diverse climates, soil types, and conditions. This can lead to suboptimal yields and increased vulnerability to environmental stresses. By leveraging AI, this project aims to bridge this knowledge gap, enabling farmers to make informed decisions that promote crop health and sustainability.
